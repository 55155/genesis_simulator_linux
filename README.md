# genesis_simulator

I am expressing a crank-slider mechanism through Genesis and MuJoCo.

The latest version is:
My_asset/Crank_slider_mechasnism_V3_description/Crank_slider_system_V3.xml
src/My_robot/Crank_slider_system_V3.py

If there are better ways to represent a closed kinematic chain, please let me know. Thank you.
